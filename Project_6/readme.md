A data visualization project.  Create a visualization using d3.js, using an iterative process with feedback from at least
3 people, documenting 2 cycles of feedback and development.  I chose a dataset of interest to me, a tabulation of heat wave
days in US counties from the CDC Wonder site.  Final code and data files included here.  All versions and documentation of
feedback on this project in a separate repo.
